Kent Beck: To Agility and Beyond
================================

- "You scratch the goat 8 times and nothing happens and then you scratch it another times and suddenly you hit the itchy spot. How do you find the spot?"
- "If you're not scratching, you're not gonna find the itchy spot."
- Lean startups just hit that spot

- Lean Startup Process: Build -> Measure -> Learn
- This loop is backwards.

- He's running a startup around TDD screencasts
- Built something, measured something, but then what do you learn?

- Next project: Started with a need: 'How can I tune up my 49-year-old brain?'
- Then: How do you measure? Take a task and time it.
- Then: What software do I need to do that?
- Start with a need.
- Next question is: Can someone else use it?
- And then: Can I get someone else to pay for it?

- So: Learn -> Measure -> Build
- Essentially a pull process.

The Agile Manifesto
===================

4 points on the Manifesto:

Processes and tools
-------------------

Then:

- 10 years ago, the Agile manifesto was a step forward
- LCD of people in the room
- Focus on Individuals and Interactions rather than set process

In startups:

- Need **team vision** and **discipline**
- Not just, how good a job I am doing, but how good of a job are we doing?
- Beyond optimizing individual performance at the cost of team performance
- Needs discipline to follow how the team does things.
  
Comprehensive documentation
---------------------------

Then:

- Working software over documentation

In startups:

- Can't measure progress by working software
- Need validated learning
- You start with a list of 'almost impossibles'
- Your job is to work out which ones actually _are_ impossible

Contract negotiation
--------------------

Then:

- Contracts don't guarantee customer satisfaction
- Collaborate with the customer instead

In startups:

- You don't have a customer! (yet)
- Points to Steve Blanks Customer Discovery

Following a plan
----------------

Then:

- "Plan the work, work the plan" myth
- There's to much change during execution
- Respond to change

In startups:

- Nothing's changing / moving yet
- Needs initiating change, not just responding
- Take the initiative (goes off on what that means in military terms)


Two principles
==============

Pull
----

See above about reverse loop.

Flow
----

- "2 deliveries is better than 1 delivery"
- Reduce cycle time.
- Increase how many times you get validation about "Can this make me money?"

- Engineering game in startups:
  + How can we slice this thinner, and rearrange the pieces.
- Built a game, didn't know if people would buy it, so they built a version that had a buy button, but there was no implementation of the payment process. Still showed them whether people would pay.

- Feels good to do good engineering, but that's not good startup engineering. Not if there's a faster / cheaper way.
- The switch comes with scaling. Then the question becomes "Is there any way we can support 2x as many customers". Then you do TDD etc.
- At one point, the question becomes "How can we squeeze more out of our existing customer base."
- Good engineering is being able to make these transitions.
- Your value system has to change.
- It's hard. As much cultural as technical.
- Whatever the question currently is, the goal in a LS is minimizing the time through the loop to validated learning.


Q & A
=====

- If you're solving your own problem, you've likely already answered the 'what do I want to learn' question, i.e. can I split up our architecture in a week?

- Q: Short term / long term balance. How?
  + Based on pull and flow:
    - Pull: Refactor / -structure when you feel the need, NOT before.
    - Flow: How can I divide the big pieces into smaller ones that can deliver value right away.
  + That means code is messy in spots.
  + It's a challenge to make the transitions at the right time.
