missed the start...

- fundamental unit of entrepreneurship is learning, not execution
- ideas -> BUILD -> code -> MEASURE -> data -> LEARN -> da capo
- minimize cycle time through that loop

Myths about the lean startup
----------------------------

- Lean == cheap
  + No, it's about speed.
  + About minimizing _waste_, not spend.
- It's only for web2.0
- Small and bootstrapped
  + That's ok, but capital is not something to be dogmatic about.
- Replaces vision with data
  + LS are _driven by a compelling vision_, and are _rigorous about testing_ all parts of this vision

Agenda
------

- What's progress look like?
- When to pivot?
- What is the Minimum Viable Product? Is it minimal?
- Does the LS scale?
- What's the role of design?
- How to reconcile vision and customer data?
