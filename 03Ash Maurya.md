Ash Maurya: Continuous Deployment
=================================

- Product Development gets in the way of learning about the customer
- Shorten cycle time!

Before and After
================

- B: 1 staging for qa and dev
- A: every dev has a full sandbox

- B: releases were full-day events
- A: Releases are non-events (< 20 mins)

- B: avg release size 100s of LOC
- A: avg release size <25 LOC

- B: had to schedule "Customer days" vs. "Coding days"
- A: now both are one

Taking the plunge
=================

- Scary: Where's the safety net?
- Much time spent in QA.
- Bugs still escaped testing.
- Very little learning during QA.
- Spent more time on test automation.

- Code in small batches.
- Don't do 100% automation from the start.

[Got bored. No big revelations in this talk.]
